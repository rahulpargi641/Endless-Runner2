# Endless-Runner2 [Blueprint]

Overview:

The player character has to run for an infinite amount of time while avoiding obstacles. The player's objective is to reach a high score by collecting coins and surviving for as long as possible, while the environment continuously spawns ahead of the player.

Implementation:

1. Used Blueprints to implement features such as platform and obstacle generation and pickups and scoring system. 
2. Implemented the player's run and jump animations, and also added a coin pickup sound effect to enhance the player experience.
